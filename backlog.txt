Features:

-Add the rest of the "super powers" functions in Player (that are called from Level)
-Fix high jump
-Make it possible to drop old "super powers" where new one was picked up (if it was exchanged)
-Create menu to choose map from
-Create 'goal' on map
-Create victory screen?
-Add enemies or something to break
-Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file




Bugs: 

Player.js:
-player can currently use high jump to jump outside of map (will then automatically
be moved into the map again)


Other:
-Can not read spawn from .json file (hardcoded) at the moment (can use the spawn point but have to call player.reset function)

Extras:
-Add timer
-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
make it toggle between two sprite
-Add animation for dying
- Countdown timer for when ability is available for use again (display)


Refactoring:
