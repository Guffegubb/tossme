Features:

-Make it possible to go back to main menu
-Make goal actually trigge an event (goes to menu or something)
-Add enemies
-Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file
-Add animation for enemies



Bugs: 

Player.js:
-player can currently use high jump to jump outside of map (will then automatically
be moved into the map again)
-if stomping and hits roof, you can stomp through the floor (gets too high
velocity)
- can use jump and high jump at the same time for super jump


Other:
-Can not read spawn from .json file (hardcoded) at the moment (can use the spawn point but have to call player.reset function)

Extras:
-Add timer
-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
make it toggle between two sprite
-Add animation for dying
-Add animation for player
- Countdown timer for when ability is available for use again (display)


Refactoring:



Polish:
-Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square
-Make you stomp on the block you have biggest part of your body on
-Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
-Stop stomping ability if dying (continues through right now), that is 
set velocity = 0 and don't do the shake
-Look at the the cooldown for swap and ability (they are the same at the moment,
implemented to make it able to use an ability while standing on a block)
-Make the menu automatically be able to adjust with 'infinite' amount of maps
