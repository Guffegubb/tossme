Features:

-Add the rest of the "super powers" functions in Player (that are called from Level)
-Fix high jump
-Display on camera the "super powers" (Think about that if we had graphics for
super powers on map we need to create some extra layers on bottom of screen
so they are not in the way), alternatively move camera
-One object for all different "super powers" : read what type from 'name' in .json, if it doesn't work,
use gid.
-Make it possible to drop old "super powers" where new one was picked up (if it was exchanged)
-Create menu to choose map from
-Create 'goal' on map
-Create victory screen?
-Add enemies or something to break
-Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file

-Can not read spawn from .json file (hardcoded) at the moment

Extras:

-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?

make it toggle between two sprite
