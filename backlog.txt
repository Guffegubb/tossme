Features:

- Implement flying enemies
- Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file?
- Intro and credits necessary for higher grade (check course page) (tween and/or alpha can be useful)
        - intro should maybe be done in PreLoader.JS file, or own state between preloader and main menu
- Implement 'unlocking' levels


Bugs: 
Player.js:
- Supress errors when trying to create objects that does not exist on map

Extras:
-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
make it toggle between two sprite
-Add animation for dying
-Countdown timer for when ability is available for use again (display) - could it be faded out and slowly fading back in?
        (otherwise load texture with the kenney.nl numbers perhaps, animating between them?
- add sounds


Refactoring:
- make as many variables as possible NOT global.. - PUT INSIDE GAME.LEVEL.PROTOTYPE BEFORE CREATE
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 
- The code for projectiles and enemy meeting
- repeated code that can be moved into own function. 

Polish:
-Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square (collisioncheck optional parameter in collide/overlap may be able to help with this)
-When using stomp and hitting head (use small camera shake, not as big as when hitting floor with stomp)
    - alternatively change sprite colour / blink - IMPLEMENTED, BUT DOESNT WORK FOR BREAKABLEOBJECTS AT THE MOMENT
-Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
-Stop stomping ability if dying (continues through right now), that is 
    set velocity = 0 and don't do the shake - CANNOT RECREATE BUG WITH CURRENT LEVELS, ALWAYS ROOF ABOVE LETHAL BLOCKS WHICH STOPS STOMPS
-Make the menu automatically be able to adjust with 'infinite' amount of maps
-Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Exit sign flashing when hovering over?
-Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
-Fix size of player sprite
- Add a bigger "whoop" for completing level, currently only returns us to main menu.
- Add roof to every map
- Add animation for player dying
- Add animation for player
- Change anchar of player?
- Make it possible to go up blocks if just a few pixels are not aligned
- Change death animation on enemies?
- Make enemies dead body not able to kill you?
- Make shoot look nicer
