Features:

-Add the "super power" functions in Player (that are called from Level)
-Display on camera the "super powers" (Think about that if we had graphics for
super powers on map we need to create some extra layers on bottom of screen
so they are not in the way), alternatively move camera
-One object for all different "super powers" : read what type from 'name' in .json, if it doesn't work,
use gid.
-Make it possible to drop old "super powers" where new one was picked up (if it was exchanged)
-Create menu to choose map from
-Create 'goal' on map
-Create victory screen?
-Add enemies or something to break
-Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file

Player.js:

Other:

-Can not read spawn from .json file (hardcoded) at the moment

Extras:

-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
make it toggle between two sprite
