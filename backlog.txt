Features:
- Music?


Bugs: 
sound muted after every level (move mute implementation to other state?)


Extras:
- add more sounds?


Refactoring:
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 
- The code for projectiles and enemy meeting
- repeated code that can be moved into own function (e.g credits/mainmenu).


Polish:
- Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
- Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
- Victory screen polish.
- Tween for when picking up ability for the first time
- Shot is less than 64 pixels now which can make it look weird since it gets 
removed before it actually hits the wall
- Polish intro when new graphics arrive
- end credits when graphic etc
- Make highJump have a cross over it if you can't use it (not on ground)
- lethalblocks should only be lethal from above!!
- touching breakable code is a bit buggy

IMPORTANT:
- Make long jump 5 squares long
