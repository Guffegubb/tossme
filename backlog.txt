Features:
- Music?


Bugs: 
- Supress errors when trying to create objects that does not exist on map
- Shots can maybe go through objects?


Extras:
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
    make it toggle between two sprite
- add more sounds?


Refactoring:
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 
- The code for projectiles and enemy meeting
- repeated code that can be moved into own function (e.g credits/mainmenu).


Polish:
- Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square (collisioncheck optional parameter in collide/overlap may be able to help with this)
- Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
- Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
- Victory screen polish.
- Add animation for player
- Make shoot look nicer
- Tween for when picking up ability for the first time
- Shot is less than 64 pixels now which can make it look weird since it gets 
removed before it actually hits the wall
- Polish intro when new graphics arrive
- end credits when graphic etc
