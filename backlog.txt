Bugs: 

Player.js:
-if stomping and hits roof, you can stomp through the floor (gets too high
velocity)

- Surpress errors when trying to crete objects that does not exist on map


Extras:

make it toggle between two sprite
-Add animation for dying

Refactoring:



Polish:
-Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square
-Make the stomp be able to destroy several blocks
-Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
-Stop stomping ability if dying (continues through right now), that is 
set velocity = 0 and don't do the shake
-Make the menu automatically be able to adjust with 'infinite' amount of maps
-Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Exit sign flashing when hovering over?
- change the exit sign for something that doesnt upset the retarded user
-Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
-Fix size of player sprite
