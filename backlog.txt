Features:

- Make it possible to interact with enemies
- Trigger event when crossing invisible line from json file?
- Add animation for enemies
- Make shoot actually do something (can kill stuff)
- Intro and credits necessary for higher grade (check course page) (tween and/or alpha can be useful)
        - intro should maybe be done in PreLoader.JS file, or own state between preloader and main menu
- Implement 'unlocking' levels


Bugs: 

Player.js:
- Supress errors when trying to create objects that does not exist on map


Extras:
-Add timer
-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
make it toggle between two sprite
-Add animation for dying
-Countdown timer for when ability is available for use again (display) - could it be faded out and slowly fading back in?
        (otherwise load texture with the kenney.nl numbers perhaps, animating between them?
- add sounds


Refactoring:
- make as many variables as possible NOT global..
- same function structure (example Ability.js vs Body.js), var x = function(), vs function x()
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 

Polish:
-Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square (collisioncheck optional parameter in collide/overlap may be able to help with this)
-Make the stomp be able to destroy several blocks
-When using stomp and hitting head (use small camera shake, not as big as when hitting floor with stomp)
    - alternatively change sprite colour / blink
-Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
-Stop stomping ability if dying (continues through right now), that is 
set velocity = 0 and don't do the shake
-Make the menu automatically be able to adjust with 'infinite' amount of maps - increase world size?
-Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Exit sign flashing when hovering over?
- change the exit sign for something that doesnt upset the retarded user
-Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
-Fix size of player sprite
- Add a bigger "whoop" for completing level, currently only returns us to main menu.
- Add roof to every map
- Add animation for player dying
- Add animation for player
