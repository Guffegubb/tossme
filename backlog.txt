Features:
- Music?
- credit kenney nl in readme file for enemies

Bugs: 
sound muted after every level (move mute implementation to other state?)


Extras:
- add more sounds?


Refactoring:
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 
- The code for projectiles and enemy meeting
- repeated code that can be moved into own function (e.g credits/mainmenu).


Polish:
- Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Victory screen polish.
- Tween for when picking up ability for the first time
- Polish intro when new graphics arrive
- end credits when graphic etc
- Make highJump have a cross over it if you can't use it (not on ground)
- touching breakable code is a bit buggy (stomp)
