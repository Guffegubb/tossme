Features:
- Intro and credits necessary for higher grade (check course page) (tween and/or alpha can be useful)
        - intro should maybe be done in PreLoader.JS file, or own state between preloader and main menu
- Music?
- Make it mutable (start as muted)

Bugs: 
- Supress errors when trying to create objects that does not exist on map

Extras:
-Add extra things to pick up?
-Easter egg?
-Make the sprite move in some kind of way, maybe just rotate when jumping, maybe 
    make it toggle between two sprite
-Countdown timer for when ability is available for use again (display) - could it be faded out and slowly fading back in?
        (otherwise load texture with the kenney.nl numbers perhaps, animating between them?
- add sounds


Refactoring:
- make as many variables as possible NOT global.. - PUT INSIDE GAME.LEVEL TOP OF FILE
- touchingBreakableBlock function is filled with ugly code and så kallade nödlösningar. 
- The code for projectiles and enemy meeting
- repeated code that can be moved into own function. 

Polish:
- Make cactus kill you when touching the cactus and not only overlaping the square (collisioncheck optional parameter in collide/overlap may be able to help with this)
- Make the long jump not give height if touching on side
- Add pause screen when clicked outside of game
- Exit sign flashing when hovering over?
- Add "are you sure you want to exit?"
- Victory screen polish.
- Add animation for player
- Change anchor of player?
- Make it possible to go up blocks if just a few pixels are not aligned
- Make shoot look nicer
- Tween for when picking up ability for the first time
- Shot is less than 64 pixels now which can make it look weird since it gets 
removed before it actually hits the wall
